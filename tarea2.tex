\textbf{60.} Show that for a right triangle the average distance from any point
in the triangle to one of the legs is one-third the length of the other leg.

In Problems 14–18, decide whether the integrals are positive,negative, or zero.
Let $S$ be the solid sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1$, and $T$ be the top half of
this sphere (with $z \geq 0$), and $B$ be the bottom half (with $z \leq 0$), and $R$
be the right half of the sphere (with $x \geq 0$), and $L$ be the left half
(with $x \leq 0$). \\

\textbf{31.} A trough with triangular cross-section lies along the $x$-axis for
$0 \leq x \leq 10$. The slanted sides are given by $z = y$ and $z = -y$ for
$0 \leq z \leq 1$ and the ends by $x = 0$ and $x = 10$, where $x, y, z$ are in meters.
The trough contains a sludge whose density at the point $(x, y, z)$ is
$\delta = e^{-3x}$ kg per $m^3$. \\

\textbf{a)} Express the total mass of sludge in the trough in terms of triple
integrals. \\

\textbf{b)} Express the total mass of sludge in the trough in terms of triple

\textbf{55.} $E$ is the region bounded by $x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, z = 2,$
and $2x + 4y + z = 4$. \\

\textbf{57.} Figure 16.28 shows part of a spherical ball of radius 5 cm.
Write an iterated triple integral which represents the volume of this region. \\

\textbf{66.} Find the center of mass of the tetrahedron that is bounded by the
$xy, yz, xz$ planes and the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 1$. Assume the density is
1 $gm/cm^3$ and $x, y, z$ are in centimeters. \\

Problems 67–69 concern a rotating solid body and its \textit{moment of inertia}
about an axis; this moment relates angular acceleration to torque (an analogue
of force). For a body of constant density and mass $m$ occupying a region $W$
of volume $V$ , the moments of inertia about the coordinate axes are

\[I_x = \frac{m}{V} \int _W (y^2 + z^2) \, \text d V \]

\[I_y = \frac{m}{V} \int _W (x^2 + z^2) \, \text d V \]

\[I_z = \frac{m}{V} \int _W (x^2 + z^2) \, \text d V \]

\textbf{67.} Find the moment of inertia about the $z$-axis of the rectangular
solid of mass $m$ given by $0 \leq x \leq 1, 0 \leq y \leq 2, 0 \leq z \leq 3$. \\

Are the statements in Problems 74–83 true or false? Give reasons for your answer. \\

\textbf{75.} The region of integration of the triple iterated integral
$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^x f dz dy dx $ lies above a square in the $xy$-plane
and below a plane. \\

\textbf{78.} The iterated integrals $\int_{-1}^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^{1-x^2} f dz dy dx $
and $\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1-z}}^{\sqrt{1-z}} f dz dy dx $ are equal. \\


\textbf{80.} If $W$ is the unit cube $0 \leq x \leq 1, 0 \leq y \leq 1, 0 \leq z \leq 1$
and $ \int _W f \, \text dV = 0$, then $f = 0$ everywhere in the unit. \\
